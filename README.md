# Noroff FED2 - JavaScript 2 CA
## Noroff Socials

This is my course assignment for the JavaScript 2 module at Noroff. The task was to build a basic social media app front-end using [Noroff‚Äôs API](https://docs.noroff.dev/docs/v2). I‚Äôve gone with a fun design based on my love for F1.

## Known Issues

### Single Post Page Not Loading on Desktop

- Clicking post titles goes to `/post/?id=xxxx`
- This works on mobile, but not desktop (even though the console shows it routing correctly)

### Things I Tried to Fix It

- Stripped query string in `router/index.js`
- Verified path `/post/` and route are correct
- Included `post/index.html` in `vite.config.js`
- Page works perfectly with `npm run dev`
- Ensured Netlify build has all script files
- Tested with `_redirects` from Netlify
- Attempted to ask teacher

Still didn‚Äôt solve it. If anyone figures it out, I‚Äôd love to hear it! üòÖ

## Final Notes

This was a big project and a lot of fun, although also very stressful. I focused on writing clean modular code, with simple styling and a cozy F1-inspired vibe inbetween some panic attacks.
